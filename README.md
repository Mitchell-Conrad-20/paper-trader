# What is PaperTrader?
PaperTrader gives users access to real stock market data and charts in order to make informed buy and sell decisions with play money. It was created as a Software Engineering and Design (CS320) project at York College of PA. For the purposes of the project, the PaperTrader market is run one day behind of the real market in order to cut out the need for paid APIs.
